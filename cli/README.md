# pkgzap-cli

‚ö°Ô∏è Boost your project dependencies via lightning!

## How to boost?

Run it in your project's root directory with
```bash
npx pkgzap-cli
```


#### ‚åõ It will start analyzing your dependencies using your package.json file:
```
Send sats to your project's dependencies!
Analyzing your package.json...
Found 21 dependencies with lightning details.
```

#### üöÄ Specify the amount you want to send to these dependencies:
```
How much do you want to send in total? Amount (in sats): 2100
```

#### ‚úÖ Approve the connection request to connect your wallet:
```
Please approve the NWC connection: https://nwc.getalby.com/apps/new?c=pkgzap&pubkey=g3tal6yf3a42c15883c68e623dfe653515506dd945e29386c46e3832d6212121
And press enter/return to continue...
```

#### üíæ The NWC URL would be encrypted and saved in your device for future use.
```
Authentication Successful. Saving the NostrWalletConnect URL...
Enter a password to encrypt the NWC URL: g3tal6y
Saved in /Users/satoshi/.pkgzap
```

#### ‚ö°Ô∏è Sit back and watch NWC do the rest!
```
Supporting 21 packages with 100 sats each...
crazy-ln-tools: Payment Successful!
pkgzap-cli: Payment Successful!
pkgzap: Payment Successful!
ln-zapper: Payment Successful!
...
```

## How to receive sats to your dependencies?
In your `package.json` file, add the following:
```
"funding": {
  "type": "lightning",
  "url": "lightning:satoshi@getalby.com"
}
```
This would help `pkgzap-cli` to pick your lightning address when your dependency users boost you!

```

              ^
